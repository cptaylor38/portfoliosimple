We experienced a number of setbacks during our concept phase of our final project and threw this together. Preview songs with the spotify api, record notes or write down songs you discover with MongoDb, and enjoy a blast from the past with this retro themed amalgamation. My role involved React integration, API development and consumption, fixing Firebase auth persistence, and user experience. It may not be the prettiest, or most intuitive, but it was a lot of fun to build.",
